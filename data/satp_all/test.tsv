The United Naga Council (UNC) termed the attempt of the State Government to pass a “similar Bill” in the Manipur Assembly as “nothing but another manifestation of State Government’s apathy towards the rights and concern of the tribal people” of the State, reports The Sangai Express on September 1. While re affirming its strong opposition to the Government’s attempt to pass a “similar Bill that led to the killing of 9 tribal people last year while protesting the 3 anti tribal Bills and resolutions”, the UNC in statement stated that attempt of the Government to pass a new Bill (Manipur Regulation of Non Local Bill 2016) in the forthcoming Manipur State Assembly session without resolving the outstanding issues that involved the loss of nine “precious lives and untold miseries clearly indicates the Imphal valley centric Government’s intention to completely suppress and silence the voice of the tribal people of the State”. Given this reason, the UNC posited its earlier stand that the State Government’s concern is “limited only to the valley people and not the indigenous tribal people”.The UNC stated that the tribal people of the State will oppose any Bill that would affect the hill areas unless the Manipur Assembly is democratised. “How can we expect any Bill passed in Manipur Assembly to be democratic when the tribal representatives are under represented against the Constitutional guideline of Article 332 ?” it questioned. According to the UNC, the root cause of many problems in the State lies in the “fact that the value of one valley vote is equivalent to 3 tribal votes”. The UNC demanded that the Government of India addresses “this critical issue” in order to achieve its goal for lasting peace and development in the region. The UNC also expressed its apprehension that the indigenous tribal people will continue to be “suppressed and will be further marginalised” despite Constitutional safeguard such as Article 371 C, Manipur Legislative Assembly (Hills Areas Committee) Order 1972, Manipur Autonomous District Council Act 1971 Reservation Rule etc. if the above pressing issue is not addressed or resolved. “	0	0	0	0

Intelligence agencies have warned that terror outfits Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT), having failed to get adequate “logistical support from sleeper cells in India”, are planning a major lone wolf attack in the coming days, Asian Age reports on October 19. Following specific intelligence inputs to this effect, nearly 75 per cent of the NSG commando force has been kept on stand by in major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, to deal with any eventuality.The home ministry had recently issued an advisory to all states to increase security during the festive season. Following surgical strikes by the Indian Army across the Line of Control, Indian intelligence inputs have revealed that Pakistan based terror groups LeT and JeM are getting “increasingly desperate” to carry out a major strike in an important Indian city. Intelligence sources claim that further investigations revealed that these terror organisations were not able to activate and get enough support from their local sleeper cells due to which the execution of a major strike did not seem possible. Thus, they have shifted their focus and are planning to use a lone wolf for the attack. “Following a high state of alert and sustained pressure by security agencies which even led to the smashing of an Islamic State (IS) module in south India by the NIA, it has become increasing difficult for sleeper cells to reactivate themselves,” a senior intelligence official said.	0	0	0	0

with a number of militant outfits of the State trying to regroup, the Assam Government has sought additional forces from the Centre, while efforts are also on to improve coordination with the neighbouring states to check movement of the ultras, reports The Assam Tribuneon December 29. Around 280 companies of forces, including more than a hundred companies of central paramilitary forces, are now engaged in counter insurgency operations in the State. However, substantial number of forces was withdrawn from Assam following the last Assembly elections and that is why the State Government has requested the Centre to send additional forces to deal with the situation.The Special Director General of Police (Law and Order) Kula Saikia admitted that as the militant groups are not in a position to create trouble alone, they are trying to regroup and work under one umbrella. He said the militants are trying to shift their modus operandi and they have started to try and use more explosives. Another major shift is that the ultras are trying to use women cadres for transporting different materials. He said that in the last four months alone, at least 17 kilograms of explosives were recovered from the militants in different parts of the State. He revealed that so far this year (2016), around 50 militants were neutralised, while more than 800 were arrested. The incidents of violence involving the militants also came down as only 30 such incidents were reported in the last four months. Replying to a question on the strategies adopted by the Police and SFs to improve the overall law and order scenario, Saikia said that bringing the Police closer to the common people is one of the major thrusts. He said that efforts are on to expand the concept of formation of citizens’ committees, which started in Guwahati in 1996. All the Police Stations of the State have been directed to set up such citizens’ committees and the entire process will be supervised by the concerned SPs.As the militants are trying to take advantage of the jungle areas along the inter state border between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, efforts are on to improve surveillance in those areas, while coordination with the Police forces of the neighbouring states has also improved. All the forces on the ground are operating in a coordinated manner and specific input based operations are being carried out. Saikia said that the attempts by the Police and SFs to chock the supply lines of the militants are yielding results. Senior NDFB IKS militant, G Bidai and the group moving around with him, are in trouble as the supply lines are chocked, while a large number of jackets and blankets were recovered when those were being taken for Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA I)militants in Margherita area in Tinsukia District.	0	0	0	0

Inspector General of Police (IGP) of Gadchiroli range, Shivaji Bodkhe insisted that the attack was not a reflection on Policing. “Though we have the Hedri police post 5 km away, on the other side is Abujmaad, where about 40 sq km area has no police presence and hence Maoists find it not so difficult.” He added that the number of attackers would hardly have been 10 to 15. “They drove the labourers away and then had no hurdle and must have gone on setting the vehicles afire one after the other.’’ Sources said that Maoists generally recce an area before targeting it, making sure that there is no Police movement. They then split into five member groups for completing a task in the shortest possible time. “In Surjagad, they must have finished the task within 30 minutes, which means there must have been Maoists and militia members by hundreds on the spot,” said a source.	0	0	0	1

Meghalaya Home minister Roshan Warjri, on April 17, said the Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA), with support from Assam based militant groups, had become a “potent force, comprising a large number of cadres, including active overground workers, adequate firepower, organizational capacity and command leadership”, reports The Telegraph. She said the outfit, which was active all over Garo hills, in certain areas of West Khasi Hills and in South West Khasi Hills, continued to be a cause for concern. “The group poses a serious challenge to security agencies engaged in anti militancy operations.

She assured the House that efforts were being made to improve intelligence network and enhance capabilities for effective intelligence based operations. “We are expecting better results in the coming months,” she added. On the Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), she said efforts by the group’s leadership to rejuvenate the organisation with recruitments, alliance with other Northeast militant organisations and raise funds through extortions had met with “limited successes only”.On border management, Warjri said in certain pockets, which are in adverse possession along the international border, like Pyrdiwah, Amki and Nongkhen, there have been reports of intrusions by Bangladesh nationals with active support of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR).On border fencing, she said of the 498.165km fencing, 226.096km had been completed while work was in progress in 106.977km. Work along 124.859km is yet to be taken up for various reasons.

Further, three months before the June 4 ambush, Government of India (GoI) was working on a strategy to use dissident NSCN K militants against the organisation, reports The Indian Express on June 9. The deal, endorsed by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, was put in place after NSCN K abrogated a ceasefire pact with GoI. Intelligence sources said the deal involved engaging NSCN K dissidents Wangting Naga and P Tikhak, who were expelled by the group in March. The two dissidents met Indian intelligence officials at Dimapur on March 27, where they were informed that New Delhi found NSCN K ‘chief’ Khaplang’s provision of military infrastructure to other North east insurgent groups unacceptable. The men were asked to push their chief to resume the ceasefire and join peace talks. Khaplang, however, rejected pleas from Naga and Tikhak, and expelled them from the organisation. The decision marked a split between the India based leadership of the NSCN K, and its ranks across the border in Myanmar, who had, in 2012, signed a separate peace treaty with that country’s army, and believed themselves secure in their bases there. New Delhi’s decision to work with NSCN K dissidents, intelligence officials say may have provoked Khaplang to resume attacks on Indian forces. Also, Khaplang has emerged as the most important insurgent leader in North East region, reports The Times of India on June 9. Khaplang, a Hemi Naga tribesman from Myanmar has edged past the Meghen ,‘chairman’ of the region s biggest outfit United National Liberation Front (UNLF) of Manipur, , who is now in Guwahati Jail. Meghen wanted to become the ‘chairman’ of the newly floated United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW) Intelligence agencies intercepted messages sent by Meghen from Guwahati jail, directing his group not to join the UNLFW if the chairman s post is not given to him. A source stated that Khaplang did not agree to this and he went ahead with the formation of the UNLFW on April 17 with just three other member outfits Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA I), IK Songbijit faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB IKS) and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO), besides NSCN K. According to the initial plan, the UNLFW was supposed to be the common platform of all NE militant outfits, including Coordination Committee (CorCom), an umbrella outfit of 6 Meitei militant groups. CorCom hasn t joined the UNLFW but Khaplang managed to get on board the two CorCom groups KYKL and Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) for June 4 ambush.	0	0	0	0

UHM hinting role of illegal immigrants, described the porous Indo Bangladesh border as a “difficult” border, which was “complex” to manage. “Assam is perhaps the most complex state to govern in this country. We have the Assamese population, we have a number of tribes, we have people who have migrated from other states and we also have a problem, which is undeniable — of people who have illegally entered Assam. That’s why it is a complex state to administer.”UHM Chidambaram also claimed that influx has come down sharply over the last few years. Chidambaram further said, “I am not saying nobody comes. However, we are acutely aware what we have to do. We need more BoPs Border Outposts , more roads. We have firmed up the border guarding plans and the execution of that need to be speeded up”. Denying intelligence failure, Chidambaram said the violence was sparked off by two incidents — one on July 6 and the other on July 19. “The two trigger incidents took place openly. But no one expected the conflagration would spread within two three days. There was not enough police force to contain it quickly. Once the forces came, they managed to control it.”	0	0	0	0

Around 700 victims of target killings in Karachi have been verified in 2012 so far for the purpose of providing compensation to their legal heirs, says Justice (retd) Zahid Qurban Alvi, head of the compensation commission for the victims of target killings on December 18, reports The News. Some political parties or groups and individuals had provided more names of victims whose verification would be finalised by December 31, 2012 and subsequently a summary would be moved to provide compensation to the heirs of the deceased, added Zahid Qurban Alvi. According to Justice Alvi, the majority of the victims belonged to three ruling parties. The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Awami National Party (ANP), Mohajir Qaumi Movement Haqiqi (MQM H), Sunni Tehreek (ST), Katchi Rabita Committee and Jaffria Alliance provided the lists of the deceased belonging to their parties. However, the Jamaat e Islami (JI) did not provide a list of its workers. Of the 700 victims, 170 belonged to the PPP, 150 to the MQM, 100 to the Jafria Alliance, 97 to the ANP, 31 to the Katchi Rabita Committee, 28 to the ST, four to the MQM H, while six people lost their lives in a Haidery bomb blast, which Alvi described as an individual case. “Since the issue of targeted killings has now become a matter of concern for everyone, the commission is also trying to ascertain the causes of the killings from the political parties concerned as well as from other sources in order to suggest ways to possibly stop it,” said Justice Alvi. He further said that the heirs of some of the victims who were killed in the year 2011 did not get the cheque and most of them belonged to the Awami National Party (ANP). He said the ANP informed the commission that the families of the slain people had migrated to their native places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and that it (the party) was facing difficulties to locate them. Justice Alvi said that last year 476 persons were identified and verified as victims of target killings. Justice Alvi, who is also chairman of the Sindh Zakat Council, said that they had decided to provide free education to two children of each victim of target killing from Zakat funds. Similarly, he added, they held successful talks with Bait ul Maal, which had promised to provide Rs 300,000 to 400,000 to each injured or disabled person, while the Provincial Government provided only Rs50,000 to each injured person.	0	0	0	0

Home Ministry issued an alert on the possibility of a terror strike by Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) modules in the coming weeks, reports Oneindia.in. The alert was issued to both the Mumbai Police and the Odisha Government. There were reports on June 21, which mentioned the possibility of terror strikes by terrorist groups, but the Home Ministry on June 22, stated that their alert was based on inputs received from Assam Police with chances of LeT targeting the Puri Rath Yatra in Odisha. The fact that the LeT has been recruiting Assamese youth for terrorist activities since 2001 unravelled the gravity of the situation. Security agencies are taking into consideration this fact and heightened alert. The LeT is understood to be remarkably expanding their base in the North East, especially the Bangladesh border areas that have seen many insurgent activities. The terror alert has been communicated to all State Police officials and has also warned of a possible strike by the LeT in Mumbai (Maharashtra) as well.

Despite a new Government in place, the situation in Balochistan has turned worse, Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry said on July 17, reports The Express Tribune. The Chief Justice made this comment while hearing the Balochistan law and order case. Then apex court bench observed that the former Government failed to protect the people of the province and everyone hoped the new government will change things for better, however, the situation has not improved. The Chief Justice further lamented zero progress in the missing persons’ case. Commenting on the sectarian violence in the province, Chief Justice Chaudhry said only one community is being targeted by the extremists. He added that the militants are strengthening because of the Government’s soft stance. Chief Secretary of Balochistan who appeared before the court today admitted that the situation in Balochistan has turned worse but assured that the Police were more active than before and have been raiding and arresting suspects. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML Nawaz) Government is planning to replace its predecessor’s flagship programme for Balochistan with a new policy after it failed to resolve the festering problems of the troubled province. “We intend to introduce a new policy … We believe a vibrant economic policy can heal the wounds of the people of the violence wrecked province,” Minister for States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON) Lieutenant General (retd) Abdul Qadir Baloch said. The previous Pakistan People’s Party led Government had introduced the Aghaz e Haqooq e Balochistan (AHB) package with much fanfare in 2009 as part of its efforts to stabilise the situation in the province. The wide ranging package which was aimed at eliminating the sense of deprivation among the people comprised six constitutional, five political, 16 administrative and 34 economic proposals. However, the Government could implement just 43 of the 61 proposals by the end of its five year constitutional tenure. The new Balochistan policy will focus on the 18 non implemented proposals of the AHB package, officials preparing the draft said. Its prime focus, according to them, will be Balochistan’s share in gas royalties from the Iran Pakistan pipeline agreement under the USD 1.4 billion pact, Islamabad intends to import 750mmcfd of gas from Tehran. The new policy will allocate a third (250mmcfd) of the gas imported under the agreement to Balochistan.	0	0	0	0

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on March 7 warned that the SIM cards becoming the new national security risk, reports Times of India. The information came out that many of the SIM cards being used by nearly 700 million mobile users in the country may have malevolent embedded software, which has put India s security agencies on tenterhooks. This new national security risk has alarmed the MHA and it intends to ask the telecom industry to replace all such imported SIMs in the country with locally manufactured ones at their own cost. According to a Government source, only 30 of the total volumes of SIM cards are imported at present, though even this figure will now be subjected to a formal evaluation of installed capacity. The fear is that the embedded software turns the SIM card into a minicomputer, which can be a cause of abuse. The security agencies are proposing that only blank SIM cards be allowed for import and the personalization process be done entirely by domestic firms. However, since this can only reduce vulnerability of future imports, MHA wants the industry to replace all existing SIMs at its own cost. The MHA also wants the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) to weed out all fake and duplicate IMEI numbers, indicating that its earlier crackdowns have not been entirely successful.	0	0	0	0
Dismissing the concept of peace talks immediately after Pakistan Government’s announcement of using force as a last resort, the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on December 17 said they have information that plans are already under way for a military operation, adding that they were ready for battle, reports Dawn. “Like previous Governments this one is a puppet of the United States (US). It s powerless and dollar hungry,” said TTP ‘spokesman’ Shahidullah Shahid. “They should happily launch a military operation against us. We have seen their military operations in the past and would like them to start this long awaited operation,” he said defiantly. However, the Government said the Taliban s tough rhetoric did not mean negotiations had failed. “Their public posturing is different from what s going on in the background,” said Tariq Azeem, a senior official in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif s team. “They want to appear tough but back channels show that they are also interested in talks.” The Taliban could not be immediately reached for comment. The Pakistan Government, earlier in the day, ruled out military action against the Taliban as its first preference and promised to persuade the militants to lay down their weapons through peace negotiations. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on National Security (CCNS) where officials confirmed their commitment to talks rather than military action. “The committee reaffirmed (the) Government s commitment to the strategy of negotiations with TTP and considers the use of other options only as a last resort,” the PM’s office said in a statement. “The committee deliberated upon the government s strategy to engage various groups of Pakistani Taliban to address issues of extremism and militancy.” The meeting focused on three key issues, including formulation of national security strategy to safeguard national interests, strategy on internal security and relations with Afghanistan.	0	0	0	0

The Centre has alerted Kerala that a dormant module of the Indian Mujahideen (IM) having links with the Islamic State (IS) militia may be planning to recruit fighters for strife torn Syria and Iraq, The Hindu reports on August 11. Sources said the IM’s links with the IS had come to light after the death of Muhammed Sajjid aka Bada Sajjid, an IM operative. He was killed during a shelling in Syria last month. The IM had been dormant in the country after the arrest of some of its top leaders such as Yasin Bhatkal, T.A. Shibili and Safdar Nagori. There were others from Kerala as well who had links with IM and Jam I yyathuk Ansurul Muslimeen. IM operatives behind bars include Thadiyanvide Nazir aka Ummer Haji, Umar Farooq, and Ibrahim Moulavi. However, intelligence sources said many absconders, including Ayub and Shoaib from Kannur and Shuhaib from Parappangadi, wanted in terror linked cases, may have joined the IS using new names and identities. Sources said the case of two missing Keralites from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar a few months ago had increased suspicion that radicalised Kerala youths were joining the IS militants. Intelligence agencies had already traced the identity of Abu Thahir, who had left his home at Puduppariyaram, near Palakkad in Kerala for Qatar, two years ago. But the Indian Consulate in Qatar had no clue if he had reached the Emirate, even as his Facebook page remained active for long after he was reported missing. Another is an unnamed Keralite youth hailing from Kunnummal in Kozhikode District. He has been missing from Ras al Khaimah in UAE for the past four months. Sources said that a Keralite’s name figured in the radar of intelligence agencies after the detention of IM sympathisers in Saudi Arabia. It was unclear whether he was still alive, sources said.	0	0	0	0

Sri Lanka s new Government on May 7 said that a domestic mechanism will be in place by September to probe into the alleged human rights violations during the final stages of decades long war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), reports Press Trust of India. Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the domestic mechanism with foreign technical expertise to probe into the allegations of war crimes will be in place when next United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session will meet in Geneva in September. All I can say is that we will have a domestic mechanism in place in time when the 30th session of UNHRC commences in September, Samaraweera said in Colombo. We promised the people a domestic mechanism to look into human rights violations. There is a timeline for its setting up. We do have a timeline, we are working according to a timetable even now. I think we will be able to meet the timeline, he added. Colombo Page adds that the Foreign Minister s statement comes days after United States (US) Secretary of State John Kerry urged Sri Lankan leaders to find truth wherever it may lead. During his brief visit to Colombo on May 2 when he was briefed on the steps being taken by the Government to promote reconciliation and address post conflict issues including missing persons, detainees and accountability, the top US official emphasized that Sri Lanka must find its own solutions to national issues. Appreciating the many positive steps that have already been taken by the Government, the Secretary offered US technical assistance for the measures, as required. The new Government is of the view that since Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome statute on international jurisdiction to war crimes, the island would execute justice through its national independent judicial mechanism. However, the new Government s call for a domestic mechanism rather than an international probe has not found favour with the Tamils. They claim to have no faith in the domestic investigation based on past experiences going slow on them and producing nothing meaningful.	0	0	0	0

Government of India (GoI) is still in the dark about the perpetrators of an ambush on the Army in Arunachal Pradesh on April 2 as it continues a unilateral ceasefire with Khaplang faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN K), reports The Telegraph on April 4. An intelligence officer stated that “It is unclear if the Khaplang group was responsible as some are suspecting other factions. The government of India still has a unilateral ceasefire with NSCN K.

Tikhak. NSCN K already has a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar Government ironically, with Wangtin, an Indian, as one of the signatories. If New Delhi repeals the ceasefire officially and enters into a peace agreement with Wangtin s proposed outfit, the NSCN (K) would become a Myanmar outfit with a handful of Indian elements. Chinwang Konyak, the adviser to the Eastern Naga People s Organisation (ENPO) a body of tribal representatives from what is called eastern Nagaland , stated that This is a blessing in disguise as the Khaplang group will be left in Myanmar.

The Taliban are our foundation and (Afghan Taliban leader) Mullah Omar is our supreme leader. That is why, from today, Ehsanullah Ehsan is no longer our spokesman.

Secret intelligence reports that have come to light in leaked US diplomatic cables pointed to efforts by “Kashmiri terrorists” to conduct November 26, 2008 Mumbai (26 11) style attacks in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab after the 26 11 attack, reports Indian Express. A classified intelligence report sent out by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009 details efforts by terrorists to “set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks” in the two States and speculates that a terror team might have already arrived in Himachal Pradesh to carry out the attack. The detailed reports, drawn up by the US State Department’s Office of Intelligence and Threat Analysis, say that terror groups have been emboldened by the Mumbai attack and are planning attacks on Indian missions abroad and key infrastructure projects in Jammu and Kashmir. “India learned in late March that up to three or more teams of terrorists, at least some of whom are Kashmiris, are planning to set off explosions and carry out terrorist attacks in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. At least one terrorist team might already have arrived in Himachal Pradesh,” a cable sent out by Clinton on March 27, 2009 says. “The terrorists allegedly intend to carry out attacks seminal to those in Mumbai,” the report, released by WikiLeaks, adds. The same cable goes on to say that as of early 2009, the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) remained capable of carrying out attacks on mainland India though there was no information on the location or nature of the attacks. “Indeed, there is little reporting to suggest counter terrorism efforts by the Pakistanis have done anything to encumber LeT’s operational network in South Asia (Himachal Pradesh and Punjab located in northwest India),” it reads. Besides attacks in Punjab and Himachal, LeT was also planning attacks on “high profile infrastructure” in Jammu and Kashmir, the report suggests. “Terrorists may be planning attacks against civilian infrastructure sites in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Possible attack locations include several dams, power stations, and three airports Leh, Kargil, and Jammu Satwari,” the report says. A similar intelligence report sent out by Clinton in December 2008 in the aftermath of the Mumbai attack also says that the LeT was “likely capable” of conducting another attack in India in the coming months. It also reveals that India shared concerns with the US that its missions abroad would be attacked by Pakistan based terror groups. While inputs in many cables point to the frustration in India over the lack of action by Pakistan against terror camps post the Mumbai attack, there is also a reference to intelligence sharing by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Chief Shuja Pasha on possible threats against Israeli targets in India.	0	0	0	0

Officials used a secret counterterrorism fund to buy wedding gifts, luxury carpets and gold jewellery for relatives of Ministers and visiting dignitaries, according to documents seen by AFP, Times of India reported on January 24. The revelations cast a spotlight on high level corruption in Pakistan as the impoverished but nuclear armed country battles a surge in Taliban violence. The National Crisis Management Cell (NCMC) received some 425 million rupees (USD 4.3 million) from Government coffers from 2009 2013, according to files obtained by Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Daily News, and seen by AFP. During that time the Federal Minister of Interior was headed by Rehman Malik, a flamboyant loyalist of former President Asif Ali Zardari s Pakistan People s Party (PPP). Many of the documents deal with payments to intelligence sources, routine maintenance of vehicles and overtime for employees. But the files also include receipts for gifts for US and British embassy officials, as well as flowers and sweets for journalists. One receipt for 70,000 rupees (USD 700) is itemized as a Pair of wrist watches for marriage of nephew of minister for interior . The documents show that on a trip to Rome for an Interpol conference in November 2012, Malik took a necklace, wooden tables and a TouchMate tablet computer as gifts. The counter terror fund was also used to buy three rugs as wedding gifts for the son of former Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf early last year. A set of 21 carat gold jewellery worth $3,000 was bought for one unnamed individual, while another was the recipient of a USD 1,500 set. A handicrafts store in Islamabad was paid some USD 23,000 in December 2012 for carpets and crafts given to local officials and delegations from the EU, Iran and India. Among the more bizarre items paid for from the fund was the USD 800 cost of four sacrificial goats, plus butchery costs — listed as stabbing charges — for the festival of Eid ul Adha. Alms to the poor and donations of sweets, flowers, and cash to a local Sufi saint were also made from the fund in 2012, the documents show.	0	0	0	0

Salem s lawyer Sudeep Pasgola argued that he could not be given the death sentence as it would violate the treaty between the two countries. The special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act (TADA) court on February 16 had found Salem and two others Mehndi Hasan and Virendra Jhamb guilty of the murder of Jain, who was shot dead outside his Juhu residence on March 7, 1995 following a property dispute. Salem, Hasan and Jhamb were charged and convicted for offences like murder and criminal conspiracy. The case is one of the most important for the Indian legal and law enforcing authorities as it involves a wanted absconding accused extradited to face the law.	0	0	0	0

42 terror training camps are operating in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and nearly 270 militants have entered into Jammu and Kashmir (J K) from across the border through Line of Control (LoC) in the last three years, says Minister of State for Home RPN Singh in Lok Sabha on August 6, reports Kashmir Times. RPN Singh said there were 1000 attempts of infiltration by militants from Pakistan and PoK through the LoC between 2010 12. Singh informed Lok Sabha that 160 militants were killed by Security Forces (SFs) while trying to infiltrate while 570 others went back to the other side of the border due to strict vigil by SFs. However, he said, 95 terrorists could infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir in 2010, 52 could infiltrate in 2011 and 121 could infiltrate in 2012. The Minister said J K has been facing Pakistan sponsored terrorism, spearheaded by Pakistani intelligence agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) for more than 20 years. The reason for increase in terror attacks is due to stepping up of the attack on security forces planned by the militant groups in the aftermath of Afzal Guru s execution in February 2013, RPN Singh told Lok Sabha in a written reply on August 6, reports Times of India. Giving statistics, Singh said that in 2012, there were 50 incidents of encounters between militants and Security Forces in J K in which 15 security personnel were killed and 65 were injured. In 2013 (up to July 28), there were 16 incidents of encounters in which 35 security personnel were killed 29 were injured. However, the casualties were not merely the result of the belligerence of militants there were also security lapses. In most of the cases of casualties, the laxity and non adherence to standard operating procedures by SFs have also been evident, Singh said. The figures show that in just seven months of this year, casualty on the side of SFs had more than doubled. Sources said this was also due to an increased thrust from Pakistan on infiltration across the border which grew by close to 80 this year.	0	0	0	0

As the Government team prepares for another meeting with the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), many of the foreign militants based in and around North Waziristan Agency (NWA) of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) feel they are facing an uncertain future and are not only seeking assurances from their hosts but are also weighing options for moving out to others places, like Afghanistan and Syria, to continue their jihad, Dawn reports on April 25. This emerged during a series of interviews conducted by Dawn correspondent mainly around NWA, on getting exclusive access to various groups and to some of the most wanted fugitives in the country. Most of us do not think that the talks would succeed. But if there is give and take from both sides then we fear the Government would try to isolate us. Our hosts did take us into confidence before the talks started, but we feel the government would put them in a tight spot and their options may be limited, said Azzaam, a senior member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). But some of the foreign militants also see the developments as an opportunity. Jihad is not restricted to a single land. We have the flexibility to move around. At the moment most brothers realise that one of the noblest jihadi fronts is Syria, said Sheikh Abdul Salam, a Saudi national based in NWA.	0	0	0	0
Rubbishing Pakistans 4 point formula for peace, India on October 1, asserted that it is ready to discuss all issues if the neighbouring country addresses just one point of ending terrorism emanating from there as she proposed National Security Advisor (NSA) level talks to address the problem, reports Daily Excelsior. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj referred to the perpetrators of 26 11 attacks who continue to roam freely in Pakistan and pressed the world community to ensure that countries which provide finances, safe havens and arms to terrorists pay a heavy price. A day after Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif raked up Kashmir, the Indian minister used the same forum to raise the issue of illegal occupation of parts of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan and said terror attacks from there are engineered to legitimise it. She made it clear that terrorism emanating from Pakistan is hampering normalisation of bilateral relations as she underlined that talks and terror cannot go together. Yesterday the Prime Minister of Pakistan proposed what he termed as a four point new peace initiative. I would like to respond. We do not need four points, we need just one give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk, Swaraj said while addressing the 193 member body of UNGA.	0	0	0	0

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been bombing Pakistans domestic buildings more than any other targets over the past decade of the drone war launched by the US, the Russia Today news channel reported while quoting a latest research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, reports Daily Times. Almost two thirds, or over 60 percent, of all US drone strikes in Pakistan targeted domestic buildings, the channel reported with reference to the joint research conducted by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), a London based non profit news group, along with the Forensic Architecture, a research unit based at Goldsmiths University, London, and Situ Research in New York. The authors of the paper analysed thousands of media reports, witness testimonies and field investigations to obtain the data on drone strikes in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. According to the study, at least 132 houses have been destroyed in more than 380 strikes over the past decade with at least 222 civilians being among the 1,500 or more people killed. On average, 6.2 people and 0.9 reported civilians died per strike on domestic buildings, the paper said, adding that these numbers may be conservative because the Bureau has found the deaths of women are dramatically underreported. The seclusion of women and children in the country which orders them to spend more time indoors make them more vulnerable to drone strikes, according to the BIJs Naming the Dead project.	0	0	0	0

Sri Lanka s upcoming presidential election promises more competition than was initially anticipated with the contest mainly centered between the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his opponent common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena, but with the tight race comes a great risk of violence, the International Crisis Group (ICG) warns, reports Colombo Page on December 11.

According to Indian Express, months before the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Kashmiri separatist leader Ghulam Nabi Fai, it had forced a Pakistani Consulate official in New York, who spied on Pakistanis living in the US in a systematic Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) campaign, to leave the country. Mohammed Tasleem, a clandestine operative of the ISI, had been posing as an FBI agent to extract information from Pakistanis living in the US and was issuing threats to keep them from speaking openly about Pakistan s Government. His activities were part of what Government officials in Washington, along with a range of Pakistani journalists and scholars say is a systematic ISI campaign to keep tabs on the Pakistani Diaspora inside America. Tasleem collected information in a variety of ways, and that on at least one occasion he passed himself off as an FBI agent to get information from one Pakistani living in the US, an unnamed American official said. The FBI brought Tasleem s activities to Leon Panetta, then the director of the CIA, and in April 2010, Panetta had a tense conversation with ISI chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha. Within days, Tasleem was spirited out of America a quiet resolution typical of the spy games among the world s powers.	0	0	0	0
